Highlight (Yellow),Location 434,,"Almost universally, the kind of performance we give on social media is positive. It’s more “Let me tell you how well things are going. Look how great I am.” It’s rarely the truth: “I’m scared. I’m struggling. I don’t know.”",Ryan Holiday,Ego Is The Enemy

Highlight (Yellow),Location 619,,"“False ideas about yourself destroy you. For me, I always stay a student. That’s what martial arts are about, and you have to use that humility as a tool. You put yourself beneath someone you trust.” This begins by accepting that others know more than you and that you can benefit from their knowledge, and then seeking them out and knocking down the illusions you have about yourself.",Ryan Holiday,Ego Is The Enemy
Highlight (Yellow),Location 632,,"A true student is like a sponge. Absorbing what goes on around him, filtering it, latching on to what he can hold.

Highlight (Yellow),Location 643,,You can’t learn if you think you already know. You will not find the answers if you’re too conceited and self-assured to ask the questions. You cannot get better if you’re convinced you are the best.,Ryan Holiday,Ego Is The Enemy

Highlight (Yellow),Location 1022,,"Pride blunts the very instrument we need to own in order to succeed: our mind. Our ability to learn, to adapt, to be flexible, to build relationships, all of this is dulled by pride.",Ryan Holiday,Ego Is The Enemy
Highlight (Yellow),Location 1054,,"Receive feedback, maintain hunger, and chart a proper course in life. Pride dulls these senses.

Highlight (Yellow),Location 1109,,"As a young man, Bill Clinton began a collection of note cards upon which he would write names and phone numbers of friends and acquaintances who might be of service when he eventually entered politics. Each night, before he ever had a reason to, he would flip through the box, make phone calls, write letters, or add notations about their interactions.

Highlight (Yellow),Location 1136,,"Every time you sit down to work, remind yourself: I am delaying gratification by doing this. I am passing the marshmallow test. I am earning what my ambition burns for. I am making an investment in myself instead of in my ego.",Ryan Holiday,Ego Is The Enemy
Highlight (Yellow),Location 1160,,"for the first couple years that you’re making stuff, what you’re making isn’t so good . . . It’s really not that great. It’s trying to be good, it has ambition to be good, but it’s not quite that good.

Highlight (Yellow),Location 1387,,the team failed terribly—partly due to the dangerous confidence that accompanies these kinds of victories—losing 12 of 22 games. This is what happens when you prematurely credit yourself with powers you don’t yet have control of.
