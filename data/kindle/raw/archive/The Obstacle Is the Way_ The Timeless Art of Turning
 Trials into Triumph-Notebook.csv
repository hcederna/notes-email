"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 88","","Our actions may be impeded . . . but there can be no impeding our intentions or dispositions. Because we can accommodate and adapt. The mind adapts and converts to its own purposes the obstacle to our acting."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 91","","The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 98","","And from what we know, he truly saw each and every one of these obstacles as an opportunity to practice some virtue: patience, courage, humility, resourcefulness, reason, justice, and creativity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 113","","Whatever we face, we have a choice: Will we be blocked by obstacles, or will we advance through and over them?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 117","","the challenge makes them better than if they’d never faced the adversity at all."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 124","","Most of us are paralyzed. Whatever our individual goals, most of us sit frozen before the many obstacles that lie ahead of us."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 152","","“Bad companies are destroyed by crisis. Good companies survive them. Great companies are improved by them.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 153","","Great individuals, like great companies, find a way to transform weakness into strength."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 156","","Like oxygen to a fire, obstacles became fuel for the blaze that was their ambition. Nothing could stop them, they were (and continue to be) impossible to discourage or contain. Every impediment only served to make the inferno within them burn with greater ferocity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 184","","There is an old Zen story about a king whose people had grown soft and entitled. Dissatisfied with this state of affairs, he hoped to teach them a lesson. His plan was simple: He would place a large boulder in the middle of the main road, completely blocking entry into the city."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 188","","With growing disappointment, the king watched as subject after subject came to this impediment and turned away. Or, at best, tried halfheartedly before giving up. Many openly complained or cursed the king or fortune or bemoaned the inconvenience, but none managed to do anything about it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 190","","After several days, a lone peasant came along on his way into town. He did not turn away. Instead he strained and strained, trying to push it out of the way. Then an idea came to him: He scrambled into the nearby woods to find something he could use for leverage. Finally, he returned with a large branch he had crafted into a lever and deployed it to dislodge the massive rock from the road. Beneath the rock were a purse of gold coins and a note from the king, which said:"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 194","","“The obstacle in the path becomes the path. Never forget, within every obstacle is an opportunity to improve our condition.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 212","","“The Things which hurt,” Benjamin Franklin wrote, “instruct.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 259","","Speculation led to disaster, he realized, and he needed to always ignore the “mad crowd” and its inclinations."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 271","","Warren Buffet’s famous adage to “be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 287","","Where one person sees a crisis, another can see opportunity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 289","","Nothing makes us feel this way; we choose to give in to such feelings."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 299","","Too often we react emotionally, get despondent, and lose our perspective. All that does is turn bad things into really bad things."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 306","","Discipline in perception lets you clearly see the advantage and the proper course of action in every situation—without the pestilence of panic or fear."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 345","","We decide what we will make of each and every situation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 347","","Our perceptions are the thing that we’re in complete control of."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 355","","step back and remember that situations, by themselves, cannot be good or bad. This is something—a judgment—that we, as human beings, bring to them with our perceptions."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 366","","There is no good or bad without us, there is only perception. There is the event itself and the story we tell ourselves about what it means."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 370","","A mistake becomes training."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 408","","There is always a countermove, always an escape or a way through, so there is no reason to get worked up. No one said it would be easy and, of course, the stakes are high, but the path is there for those ready to take it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 414","","If your nerve holds, then nothing really did “happen”—our perception made sure it was nothing of consequence."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 431","","With enough exposure, you can adapt out those perfectly ordinary, even innate, fears that are bred mostly from unfamiliarity."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 442","","Obstacles make us emotional, but the only way we’ll survive or overcome them is by keeping those emotions in check—if we can keep steady no matter what happens, no matter how much external events may fluctuate."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 484","","The phrase “This happened and it is bad” is actually two impressions. The first—“This happened”—is objective. The second—“it is bad”—is subjective."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 488","","the observing eye sees simply what is there. The perceiving eye sees more than what is there."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 508","","Marcus Aurelius had a version of this exercise where he’d describe glamorous or expensive things without their euphemisms—roasted meat is a dead animal and vintage wine is old, fermented grapes. The aim was to see these things as they really are, without any of the ornamentation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 512","","Objectivity means removing “you”—the subjective part—from the equation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 517","","Take your situation and pretend it is not happening to you. Pretend it is not important, that it doesn’t matter. How much easier would it be for you to know what to do?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 532","","Perspective is everything."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 536","","The task, as Pericles showed, is not to ignore fear but to explain it away. Take what you’re afraid of—when fear strikes you—and break it apart."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 547","","“business opportunities are like buses; there’s always another coming around.” One meeting is nothing in a lifetime of meetings, one deal is just one deal. In fact, we may have actually dodged a bullet. The next opportunity might be better."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 562","","He realized that casting is an obstacle for producers, too—they need to find somebody, and they’re all hoping that the next person to walk in the room is the right somebody. Auditions were a chance to solve their problem, not his."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 566","","he was the man for the job. That he understood what the casting director and producers were looking for in a specific role and that he would deliver it in each and every situation, in preproduction, on camera, and during promotion."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 570","","Where the head goes, the body follows. Perception precedes action. Right action follows the right perspective."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 580","","If there was a chance, he was ready to take it and make good use of it—ready to give every ounce of effort and energy he had to make it happen. If effort would affect the outcome, he would die on the field before he let that chance go to waste."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 600","","The things that Tommy John could change—when he had a chance—got a full 100 percent of the effort he could muster."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 604","","God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change The courage to change the things I can, And the wisdom to know the difference."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 627","","Focusing exclusively on what is in our power magnifies and enhances our power."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 658","","Focus on the moment, not the monsters that may or may not be up ahead."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 662","","Our problem is that we’re always trying to figure out what things mean—why things are the way they are."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 663","","Emerson put it best: “We cannot spend the day in explanation.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 676","","Focus on what is in front of you, right now. Ignore what it “represents” or it “means” or “why it happened to you.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 679","","Genius is the ability to put into effect what is in your mind. There’s no other definition of it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 681","","Steve Jobs"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 682","","notoriously dismissive of phrases such as “It can’t be done” or “We need more time.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 684","","To him, when you factored in vision and work ethic, much of life was malleable."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 690","","He knew that to aim low meant to accept mediocre accomplishment. But a high aim could, if things went right, create something extraordinary."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 694","","Because though our doubts (and self-doubts) feel real, they have very little bearing on what is and isn’t possible."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 695","","Our perceptions determine, to an incredibly large degree, what we are and are not capable of. In many ways, they determine reality itself."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 699","","we shouldn’t listen too closely to what other people say (or to what the voice in our head says, either). We’ll find ourselves erring on the side of accomplishing nothing."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 710","","Jobs refused to tolerate people who didn’t believe in their own abilities to succeed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 721","","An entrepreneur is someone with faith in their ability to make something where there was nothing before."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 753","","As Laura Ingalls Wilder put it: “There is good in everything, if only we look for it.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 808","","It’s a huge step forward to realize that the worst thing to happen is never the event, but the event and losing your head. Because then you’ll have two problems"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 820","","directed action. Everything must be done in the service of the whole."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 822","","Our movements and decisions define us: We must be sure to act with deliberation, boldness, and persistence."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 882","","No one is saying you can’t take a minute to think, Dammit, this sucks. By all means, vent. Exhale. Take stock. Just don’t take too long. Because you have to get back to work. Because each obstacle we overcome makes us stronger for the next one."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 905","","start. Anywhere. Anyhow. They don’t care if the conditions are perfect or if they’re being slighted. Because they know that once they get started, if they can just get some momentum, they can make it work."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 918","","So the first step is: Take the bat off your shoulder and give it a swing. You’ve got to start, to go anywhere."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 920","","Could you be doing more? You probably could—there’s always more. At minimum, you could be trying harder. You might have gotten started, but your full effort isn’t in it—and that shows."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 929","","While overpaid CEOs take long vacations and hide behind e-mail autoresponders, some programmer is working eighteen-hour days coding the start-up that will destroy that CEO’s business."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 937","","Be deliberate, of course, but you always need to be moving forward. And that’s the final part: Stay moving, always."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 953","","If you want momentum, you’ll have to create it yourself, right now, by getting up and getting started."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 970","","We will not be stopped by failure, we will not be rushed or distracted by external noise. We will chisel and peg away at the obstacle until it is gone. Resistance is futile."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 980","","genius often really is just persistence in disguise."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 984","","if Edison needed to find a needle in a haystack, he would “proceed at once” to simply “examine straw after straw until he found the object of his search.” Well, sometimes that’s exactly the right method."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 988","","refusing to give up. Turning over in their minds option after option, and trying each one with equal enthusiasm. Knowing that eventually—inevitably—one will work."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 995","","Their genius was unity of purpose, deafness to doubt, and the desire to stay at it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1004","","never stopping short"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1010","","Doing new things invariably means obstacles. A new path is, by definition, uncleared. Only with persistence and time can we cut away debris and remove impediments."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1020","","Settle in for the long haul and then try each and every possibility, and you’ll get there."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1022","","We’re working on it. We’re getting closer. When setbacks come, we respond by working twice as hard."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1026","","they release their “Minimum Viable Product” (MVP)—the most basic version of their core idea with only one or two essential features."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1027","","The point is to immediately see how customers respond. And, if that response is poor, to be able to fail cheaply and quickly."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1035","","It gets stronger by failure, dropping the features that don’t work, that customers don’t find interesting, and then focusing the developers’ limited resources on improving the features that do."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1072","","the world is telling you something with each and every failure and action. It’s feedback—giving you precise instructions on how to improve,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1076","","Failure shows us the way—by showing us what isn’t the way."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1088","","you’ve got to do something very difficult. Don’t focus on that. Instead break it down into pieces. Simply do what you need to do right now. And do it well. And then move on to the next thing."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1128","","how many people are paralyzed by all their ideas and inspirations? They chase them all and go nowhere, distracting themselves and never making headway. They’re brilliant, sure, but they rarely execute. They rarely get where they want and need to go."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1131","","We are A-to-Z thinkers, fretting about A, obsessing over Z, yet forgetting all about B through Y."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1141","","the process. Depend on it. Lean on it. Trust in it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1159","","Often when we are just starting out, our first jobs “introduce us to the broom,” as Andrew Carnegie famously put it. There’s nothing shameful about sweeping. It’s just another opportunity to excel—and to learn."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1168","","An artist is given many different canvases and commissions in their lifetime, and what matters is that they treat each one as a priority. Whether it’s the most glamorous or highest paying is irrelevant. Each project matters, and the only degrading part is giving less than one is capable of giving."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1245","","Steve Jobs, the supposed perfectionist, knew that at some point, you have to compromise. What mattered was that you got it done and it worked."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1248","","Don’t think small, but make the distinction between the critical and the extra. Think progress, not perfection."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1297","","having the advantage of size or strength or power is often the birthing ground for true and fatal weakness. The inertia of success makes it much harder to truly develop good technique."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1302","","when pushed, the natural instinct is always to push back. But martial arts teach us that we have to ignore this impulse. We can’t push back, we have to pull until opponents lose their balance. Then we make our move."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1316","","Remember, sometimes the longest way around is the shortest way home."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1323","","Sometimes you overcome obstacles not by attacking them but by withdrawing and letting them attack you. You can use the actions of others against themselves instead of acting yourself."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1350","","Sometimes in your life you need to have patience—wait for temporary obstacles to fizzle out. Let two jousting egos sort themselves out instead of jumping immediately into the fray. Sometimes a problem needs less of you—fewer people period—and not more."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1352","","When we want things too badly we can be our own worst enemy. In our eagerness, we strip the very screw we want to turn and make it impossible to ever get what we want. We spin our tires in the snow or mud and dig a deeper rut—one that we’ll never get out of."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1411","","External factors influence the path, but not the direction: forward."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1434","","learn how to press forward precisely when everyone around you sees disaster."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1437","","“You never want a serious crisis to go to waste. Things that we had postponed for too long, that were long-term, are now immediate and must be dealt with. [A] crisis provides the opportunity for us to do things that you"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1526","","“This too shall pass” was Lincoln’s favorite saying,"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1603","","Nobody is born with a steel backbone. We have to forge that ourselves."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1617","","fortress inside of us that no external adversity can ever break down. An important caveat is that we are not born with such a structure; it must be built and actively reinforced."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1629","","the way to strengthen an arch is to put weight on it—because it binds the stones together, and only with tension does it hold weight—is"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1630","","The path of least resistance is a terrible teacher. We can’t afford to shy away from the things that intimidate us."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1647","","A premortem is different. In it, we look to envision what could go wrong, what will go wrong, in advance, before we start."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1676","","The only guarantee, ever, is that things will go wrong. The only thing we can use to mitigate this is anticipation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1677","","the only variable we control completely is ourselves."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1712","","It doesn’t always feel that way but constraints in life are a good thing. Especially if we can accept them and let them direct us. They push us to places and to develop skills that we’d otherwise never have pursued."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1729","","When the cause of our problem lies outside of us, we are better for accepting it and moving on."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1767","","(a) you’re robust and resilient enough to handle whatever occurs, (b) you can’t do anything about it anyway, and (c) you’re looking at a big-enough picture and long-enough time line that whatever you have to accept is still only a negligible blip on the way to your goal."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1780","","looking for his son. “Go get your mother and all her friends,” he told his son with childlike excitement. “They’ll never see a fire like this again.” What?! Don’t worry, Edison calmed him. “It’s all right. We’ve just got rid of a lot of rubbish.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1797","","loving whatever happens to us and facing it with unfailing cheerfulness. It is the act of turning what we must do into what we get to do."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1809","","always calm, always in control, genuinely loving the opportunity to prove himself, to perform for people, whether they wanted him to succeed or not."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1826","","We don’t get to choose what happens to us, but we can always choose how we feel about it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1837","","there is always some good—even if only barely perceptible at first—contained within the bad."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1857","","The Germans have a word for it: Sitzfleisch. Staying power. Winning by sticking your ass to the seat and not leaving until after it’s over."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1871","","There are far more failures in the world due to a collapse of will than there will ever be from objectively conclusive external events."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1891","","No matter how many times we are thrown back, we alone retain the power to decide to go once more. Or to try another route. Or, at the very least, to accept this reality and decide upon a new aim."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1894","","Churchill’s old acronym: KBO. Keep Buggering On."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1933","","People are getting a little desperate. People might not show their best elements to you. You must never lower yourself to being a person you don’t like. There is no better time than now to have a moral and civic backbone. To have a moral and civic true north. This is a tremendous opportunity for you, a young person, to be heroic."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1950","","Start thinking: Unity over Self. We’re in this together."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1952","","We’re going to be of service to others. Help ourselves by helping them. Becoming better because of it, drawing purpose from it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1963","","You can always remember that a decade earlier, a century earlier, a millennium earlier, someone just like you stood right where you are and felt very similar things, struggling with the very same thoughts."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1965","","Embrace this power, this sense of being part of a larger whole."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1966","","We’re all just trying to survive, and in the process, inch the world forward a little bit."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1979","","Coming so close to death energized him, made him curious. No longer was death something to be afraid of—looking it in the eyes had been a relief, even inspiring."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2071","","It is an opportunity. Always."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2080","","Nothing stands in their way. Rather, everything guides them on the way."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2111","","See things for what they are. Do what we can. Endure and bear what we must. What blocked the path now is a path. What once impeded action advances action. The Obstacle is the Way."
