"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 245","","using an apology and his first name, seeding more warmth into the interaction in order to complicate his gambit to bulldoze me."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 249","","one of the FBI’s most potent negotiating tools: the open-ended question."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 316","","“It’s a passive-aggressive approach. I just ask the same three or four open-ended questions over and over and over and over. They get worn out answering and give me everything I want.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 392","","Framing Effect, which demonstrates that people respond differently to the same choice depending on how it is framed (people place greater value on moving from 90 percent to 100 percent—high probability to certainty—than from 45 percent to 55 percent, even though they’re both ten percentage points)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 395","","Prospect Theory explains why we take unwarranted risks in the face of uncertain losses."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 395","","Loss Aversion, which shows how people are statistically more likely to act to avert a loss than to achieve an equal gain."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 441","","What were needed were simple psychological tactics and strategies that worked in the field to calm people down, establish rapport, gain trust, elicit the verbalization of needs, and persuade the other guy of our empathy."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 449","","It all starts with the universally applicable premise that people want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there. By listening intensely, a negotiator demonstrates empathy and shows a sincere desire to better understand what the other side is experiencing."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 472","","Negotiation serves two distinct, vital life functions—information gathering and behavior influencing—and includes almost any interaction where each party wants something from the other side."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 489","","Effective negotiation is applied people smarts, a psychological edge in every domain of life: how to size someone up, how to influence their sizing up of you, and how to use that knowledge to get what you want."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 584","","Your goal at the outset is to extract and observe as much information as possible."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 589","","Great negotiators are able to question the assumptions that the rest of the involved players accept on faith or in arrogance, and thus remain more emotionally open to all possibilities, and more intellectually agile to a fluid situation."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 595","","be aware of a counterpart’s overuse of personal pronouns—we/they or me/I. The less important he makes himself, the more important he probably is (and vice versa)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 618","","In some standoffs, we had as many as five people on the line, analyzing the information as it came in, offering behind-the-scenes input and guidance to our man on the phone—and that’s how we were set up here."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 633","","everyone just listening to the voice in their head (and not well, because they’re doing seven or eight other things at the same time). It may look like there are only two people in a conversation, but really it’s more like four people all talking at once."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 639","","The goal is to identify what your counterparts actually need (monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise) and get them feeling safe enough to talk and talk and talk some more about what they want."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 642","","But neither wants nor needs are where we start; it begins with listening, making it about the other people, validating their emotions, and creating enough trust and safety for a real conversation to begin."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 666","","Going too fast is one of the mistakes all negotiators are prone to making."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 693","","The best way to describe the late-night FM DJ’s voice is as the voice of calm and reason."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 703","","That’s why your most powerful tool in any verbal communication is your voice."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 718","","When people are in a positive frame of mind, they think more quickly, and are more likely to collaborate and problem-solve (instead of fight and resist). It applies to the smile-er as much as to the smile-ee: a smile on your face, and in your voice, will increase your own mental agility."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 751","","Mirroring, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation. It’s another neurobehavior humans (and other animals) display in which we copy each other to comfort each other. It can be done with speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 892","","It’s just four simple steps:         1.      Use the late-night FM DJ voice.         2.      Start with “I’m sorry . . .”         3.      Mirror.         4.      Silence. At least four seconds, to let the mirror work its magic on your counterpart.         5.      Repeat."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 907","","The intention behind most mirrors should be “Please, help me understand.” Every time you mirror someone, they will reword what they’ve said."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 958","","■    Mirrors work magic. Repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1017","","They were able to think from another person’s point of view while they were talking with that person and quickly assess what was driving them."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1043","","“the supreme art of war”: to subdue the enemy without fighting."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1055","","Labeling is a way of validating someone’s emotion by acknowledging it. Give someone’s emotion a name and you show you identify with how that person feels."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1084","","When you say “I,” it says you’re more interested in yourself than the other person, and it makes you take personal responsibility for the words that follow—and the offense they might cause."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1124","","The fastest and most efficient means of establishing a quick working relationship is to acknowledge the negative and diffuse it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1126","","I’ve found the phrase “Look, I’m an asshole” to be an amazingly effective way to make problems go away."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1137","","Research shows that the best way to deal with negativity is to observe it, without reaction and without judgment. Then consciously label each negative feeling and replace it with positive, compassionate, and solution-based thoughts."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1223","","The first step of doing so is listing every terrible thing your counterpart could say about you, in what I call an accusation audit."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1539","","everyone you meet is driven by two primal urges: the need to feel safe and secure, and the need to feel in control. If you satisfy those drives, you’re in the door."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1566","","You use a question that prompts a “No” answer, and your counterpart feels that by turning you down he has proved that he’s in the driver’s seat."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1813","","Before you convince them to see what you’re trying to accomplish, you have to say the things to them that will get them to say, “That’s right.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1840","","(paraphrasing + labeling = summary)."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 1884","","Whenever someone is bothering you, and they just won’t let up, and they won’t listen to anything you have to say, what do you tell them to get them to shut up and go away? “You’re right.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2023","","The win-win mindset pushed by so many negotiation experts is usually ineffective and often disastrous. At best, it satisfies neither side."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2026","","Because compromise—“splitting the difference”—can lead to terrible outcomes. Compromise is often a “bad deal” and a key theme we’ll hit in this chapter is that “no deal is better than a bad deal.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2043","","never split the difference."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2049","","Deadlines regularly make people say and do impulsive things that are against their best interests, because we all have a natural tendency to rush as a deadline approaches."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2082","","Car dealers are prone to give you the best price near the end of the month, when their transactions are assessed."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2124","","you approach a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you’re wrong,” I say. “That’s not empathy; that’s projection.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2130","","We’re all irrational, all emotional. Emotion is a necessary element to decision making that we ignore at our own peril."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2139","","People comply with agreements if they feel they’ve been treated fairly and lash out if they don’t."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2147","","the negative emotional value of unfairness outweighs the positive rational value of the money."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2205","","What does a good babysitter sell, really? It’s not child care exactly, but a relaxed evening. A furnace salesperson? Cozy rooms for family time. A locksmith? A feeling of security. Know the emotional drivers and you can frame the benefits of any deal in language that will resonate."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2216","","You’re going to think to yourself that $20 for three minutes is $400 an hour. You’re going to be thrilled. What if then you find out that by getting you to run that errand I made a million dollars. You’d go from being ecstatic for making $400 an hour to being angry because you got ripped off."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2226","","The theory argues that people are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2226","","That’s called the Certainty Effect. And people will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains. That’s called Loss Aversion."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2237","","By anchoring their emotions in preparation for a loss, you inflame the other side’s loss aversion so that they’ll jump at the chance to avoid it."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2288","","“I’m worth $110,000,” Jerry might have said, “At top places like X Corp., people in this job get between $130,000 and $170,000.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2312","","The biggest thing to remember is that numbers that end in 0 inevitably feel like temporary placeholders, guesstimates that you can easily be negotiated off of."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2367","","Ask: “What does it take to be successful here?”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2594","","What’s so powerful about the senior doctor’s technique is that he took what was a showdown—“I’m going to leave” versus “You can’t leave”—and asked questions that led the patient to solve his own problem . . . in the way the doctor wanted."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2640","","start with a list of words people know as reporter’s questions: “who,” “what,” “when,” “where,” “why,” and “how.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2642","","“what,” “how,” and sometimes “why.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2659","","■    What about this is important to you?         ■    How can I help to make this better for us?         ■    How would you like me to proceed?         ■    What is it that brought us into this situation?         ■    How can we solve this problem?         ■    What’s the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?         ■    How am I supposed to do that?"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 2684","","He visibly relaxed as he sat back in his chair and brought the top of his fingers and thumbs together in the shape of a steeple. Generally this is a body language that means the person feels superior and in charge."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3000","","only 7 percent of a message is based on the words while 38 percent comes from the tone of voice and 55 percent from the speaker’s body language and face."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3005","","pay very close attention to tone and body language to make sure they match up with the literal meaning of the words. If they don’t align, it’s quite possible that the speaker is lying or at least unconvinced."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3022","","The Rule of Three is simply getting the other guy to agree to the same thing three times in the same conversation. It’s tripling the strength of whatever dynamic you’re trying to drill into at the moment. In"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3032","","Either way, going at the same issue three times uncovers falsehoods as well as the incongruences between words and body language we mentioned in the last section."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3039","","on average, liars use more words than truth tellers and use far more third-person pronouns."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3041","","liars tend to speak in more complex sentences in an attempt to win over their suspicious counterparts."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3047","","The more in love they are with “I,” “me,” and “my” the less important they are."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3073","","“My name is Chris. What’s the Chris discount?”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3194","","I gave him an understanding nod and pursed my lips. The key to beginning a haggle is to rattle the other guy ever so gently."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3208","","“Wow, your offer is very generous and this is the car of my dreams,” I said. “I really wish I could do that. I really do. This is so embarrassing. I simply can’t.”"
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3479","","1.      Set your target price (your goal).         2.      Set your first offer at 65 percent of your target price.         3.      Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100 percent).         4.      Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying “No” to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer.         5.      When calculating the final amount, use precise, nonround numbers like, say, $37,893 rather than $38,000. It gives the number credibility and weight.         6.      On your final number, throw in a nonmonetary item (that they probably don’t want) to show you’re at your limit."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3634","","None of the events above was predicted—yet on reflection, the markers were all there. It’s just that people weren’t paying attention."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3699","","You have to feel for the truth behind the camouflage; you have to note the small pauses that suggest discomfort and lies. Don’t look to verify what you expect. If you do, that’s what you’ll find. Instead, you must open yourself up to the factual reality that is in front of you."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3953","","your counterpart is not irrational, but simply ill-informed, constrained, or obeying interests that you do not yet know, your field of movement greatly expands."
"Highlight (Yellow)","Location 3980","","During a typical business meeting, the first few minutes, before you actually get down to business, and the last few moments, as everyone is leaving, often tell you more about the other side than anything in between."
